  <title>Russia Continues to be Excluded from Sports as Sanctions on the Country Mount</title>
  <p>Earlier this week the International Olympic Committee announced their plans to bar Russian athletes and teams from competing in the wake of the country’s invasion of Ukraine. Since the appeal of the IOC was announced several other international sports governing bodies have announced their plans to ban athletes from Russia within these competitions. Some of the sports involved in this boycott of Russian Athletes include: skiing, basketball, track, curling, rugby, soccer, hockey, and figure skating.</p>

    <h2>Social Implications</h2>
    <p>The IOC is usually dedicated to the unity and fairness of all sports. Whilst they vow to never directly punish athletes for the actions of their respective country’s governments, the IOC’s reasoning behind these decisions was because of Russia hindering the ability of Ukrainian athletes to compete at international sporting events. This ban is sure to host a mass of social implications with Russia being such a sports powerhouse. This ban has ruled out a potential “podium sweep” for the Figure Skating Federation of Russia at the upcoming world figure skating championships in France later this month. This comes as quite a shock considering the heat on the FSFR after they found themselves in the midst of a doping scandal just a month ago at the Beijing Winter Olympics. The removal of Russia from the figure skating world allows for other figure skating strongholds such as Japan and the United States to sweep in and win some events for the first time in about 5 years. Just this past week Russian Cross-Country skiers, who secured eleven medals at the olympics, were sent home from Norway after being excluded from competition due to the Norwegian Ski Federations sanctions on the athletes in protest of Russia’s actions against Ukraine.</p>

    <h2>Economical Implications</h2>
    <p>The world continues to face the results of Russia’s attack on Ukraine, but what does a ban on Russian athletes and sports have to do economically? Well for Russia things are not looking too good. Several international sporting events have pulled out of being hosted in Russia which is guaranteed to cost Russia millions of dollars in potential revenue from these events. Perhaps the most prominent example of this would be the International Volleyball Federation stripping Russia of hosting the Men’s world championship in August of this year. The governing body of international swimming known as FINA has revoked a federation honor awarded to Russia’s president back in 2014.</p>

    <h2>Political Implications</h2>
    <p>As the barring of Russia from the majority of sports is still a developing situation, the political implications of this are still to be seen. One can assume that Russia’s relationships with many sport institutions as well as the IOC have been permanently stained. This could lead to a potential exodus of Russian athletes from sporting events, or even from the country itself as they seek citizenship elsewhere to be allowed to compete within their sports again. Perhaps one political implication could be that many of these sanctions are being thrust upon Belarus athletes as well for their country’s alliance with Russia in this progressing situation.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>It would appear Russia's plans post Ukraine are unkown at this time, however the history of Russia's involvment in interational sports has been forever changed. Whilst I agree with the IOC and these sporting organizations for their decision to sanction Russia, I also cannot help but have a sense of sadness for the country’s athletes who are indefinitely being banned from sport competition.</p>
