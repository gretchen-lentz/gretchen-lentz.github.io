  <p>Webster dictionary defines the term inspiration as "to make (someone) want to do something : to give (someone) an idea about what to do or create." There are many influential people out there both past and present who inspire those around them. From Martin Luther King Jr. inspiring today's civil rights activists, to the current number onhe tik tok star inspiring a 12 year old girl to sign up for dance lessons, inspiration surronds us.</p>
  <p>Personally, I have always been inspired by athletes and their imense talent and dedication. This most likley has to do with the fact that I grew up surronded by sports. Everyone in my family played a sport, I lived in a town that was known for churning out olympic athletes, and of course was involved in a host of sports myself. For me I consider the following the most "inspiring" things about a person:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>They show consistent hardwork and dedication in the things they are most passionate about</li>
    <li>They are able to motivate others with their actions and story</li>
    <li>They give back to the areas that have given so much to them</li>
    <li>They show honesty and integrety and showcase that within their talents</li>
  </ul>
  <p>My entire life I have loved the sport of figure skating. I started skating at eight years old, and then began competing at eleven. For the sport, eleven is considered a pretty late age to begin skating competitivley, as most girls start at around ages seven or eight. I have watched Mariah Bell at every single National Championship, Grand Prix event, and Olympic Qualifier since she was first eligible to compete internationally in 2014. She has always taken every competition with such strength and pride, and no matter how good or bad she performs she reflects on how grateful she is to even have the oppurtunity to attend these competitions and learn from each one. Mariah has defied the odds more and more every year. She has competed on the senior level for 8 years now and shows no signs of slowing down. She has missed the olympic team the last two times she has tried, but this year she came out ready to win. And she did excactly that. At twenty-five years old Mariah is definitley not considered "prime age" for figure skating. However despite all the odds telling her "no", Mariah won first place at this year's national championship and has now become the oldest U.S. woman to ever make the olympic figure skating team. Mariah Bell is an inspiration to all young or old figure skaters that age is just a number and that you can do whatever you put your mind to!</p>
