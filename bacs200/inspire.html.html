		<p> Ronald Reagan was the 40th president of the United states. His speeches are some of the most inspiring I have ever heard or studied. He inspires me because no matter how stressful the situation or time he would communicate with calmness and structure. That is how I one day wish to run my business, witht the same determination, structure, and calmness that Reagan was able to lead this country with. </p>
