    <h1>Amusing</h1>
    <p>by Gretchen Lentz</p>

    <p>The world wide web truly is a magical place.</p>
    <p>You can find anything from the latest news to a step by step guide to pull the ultimate prank on your roommate. I personally love having the internet around to provide me with quality entertainment such as the links below.</p>

    <h2>Want a laugh?</h2>
    <p>I personally have a pretty "slap happy" type of humor if you will. Therfore I find some pretty dumb things funny such as the video below.</p>
    <a href="https://youtu.be/Nyseujl6JHg">Bears Dancing to Sweet Dreams</a>

    <h2>A good joke. A GREAT joke even.</h2>
    <p>School Pride is a great thing. Having a good laugh about the things that make your school your school-even better.</p>
